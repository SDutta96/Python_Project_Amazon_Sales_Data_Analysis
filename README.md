### Findings:
> 1. The plots above show that the majority of buyers are female, and females have spent the highest total amount on shopping.
> 2: From the plot above, we can observe that females in the 26-35 age group have made the most purchases, and this group has also spent the highest amount during shopping.
> 3: According to the plot above, Uttar Pradesh is the state with the highest number of orders and also the highest total order amount followed by Maharashtra and Karnataka.
> 4: According to the plot above, unmarried females are placing the most orders and spending the highest amount on shopping.**
> 5: From the plots above, we observe that females in the IT sector are placing the most orders, with the highest total order amount. Conversely, people in the agriculture sector are placing the fewest orders, with the lowest total amount spent.**
> 6: From the two plots above, we can see that people have primarily ordered items in the Clothing & Apparel category, followed by Food products and Electronics & Gadgets. However, the highest spending has been on Food items.

### Conclusion:
The analysis reveals that females, particularly those aged 26-35 and working in the IT sector, are the primary consumers, contributing the highest in terms of both purchase volume and spending. Unmarried females show a significant purchasing pattern, with the majority of their spending focused on categories like Food and Clothing & Apparel. Geographically, Uttar Pradesh leads in both order volume and spending, with Maharashtra and Karnataka following. While most orders fall within the Clothing & Apparel category, the largest share of spending is on Food products, indicating a preference for essentials and consumables among high-spending customers.
